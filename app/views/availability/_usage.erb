## HOW TO SEND YOUR AVAILABILITY FOR AN EVENT TO THE LIST *<%= list_id %>*

Once someone proposes an event to the list, you'll get an email to which you can
reply with your availability. Or you can send an email directly to
   
   <%= availability_address(list_id, 'n') %>
   
where 'n' is the sequential ID assigned to the event (typically 1, unless
multiple events have been scheduled for the list).

The *subject* of the email is ignored by the scheduler, and can be whatever you
want.

The *body* of the email must follow the following syntax rules. For this reason,
when replying you should **delete previous messages** and start with a blank
email body.

**(Note these rules may change, so stay tuned!)**

1. The first non-blank line of the email *may* contain your timezone offset,
expressed as +HH:MM or -HH:MM. (Note that timezone abbreviations are *not* 
currently accepted). If you don't specify a timezone offset, all times will be
interpreted as UTC (+00:00).

2. The rest of the email *must* contain one or more _sets of available days and 
times_, divided by one or more blank lines.

3. A _set of available days and times_ consists of a single line with days of 
the week, followed by one or more lines with time ranges representing available
periods during each of the days.  So for example here are two sets of 
availability:

    Monday Wednesday Friday
    11am - 2pm
    4pm - 6:30pm
    
    Thursday
    10am - 1pm
    
4. Note that the days of the week will be interpreted based on the dates 
proposed for the event. So if the event is scheduled for a single day (instead
of sometime within a week), you should specify your availability for the day of 
the week that day falls on.

5. Three-letter day of the week abbreviations can be used: Mon,Tue,Wed, etc.,
as well as one/two-letter abbreviations: M,Tu,W,Th,F,Sa,Su . Capitalization and 
extra spacing are ignored.

6. Times are in 12- or 24- hour format, with or without minutes. Anything that
ruby can parse as a time, basically. They are separated by a hyphen, and extra
spacing is ignored.
