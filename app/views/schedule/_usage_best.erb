## HOW TO REQUEST THE BEST CURRENT TIMESLOTS FOR AN EVENT

Once at least two participants have sent in their availability for an event, 
anyone on the list can request a listing of the _best current timeslots_ for
scheduling the event -- the timeslots where maximum number can participate.

Send an email to 
  
  <%= schedule_address(list_id, 'n') %>
  
where 'n' is the sequential ID for the event (the same as for sending in your
availability).

The response email will also list which participants still need to send in their
availability.
