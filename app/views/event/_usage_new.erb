## HOW TO PROPOSE AN EVENT TO THE LIST *<%= list_id %>*

Event proposals should be sent to **<%= new_event_address(list_id) %>** .

The *body* of the email is completely free-text: use it to describe the event to 
list members and to ask them to send in their availability for it.

The *subject line* must follow the following syntax rules:
**(Note these rules may change, so stay tuned!)**

1. The subject has three parts: the *name* of the event, the *range* of proposed 
dates, and the proposed *duration*.


2. These parts are divided by the pipe "|" character. Any spaces before or after
the | are stripped off.


3. The **name** of the event can be anything. But if it starts with the text 
*availability for*, that will be stripped off. So

    Availability for All Hands Meeting   => All Hands Meeting

and

    All Hands Meeting  => All Hands Meeting

    
4. The **date range** currently can be either a week or a single day. To specify
a week, use the first day of the week like:

    week of Mar 19
    
The format of the date can be anything that ruby can `Time.parse()`. If you don't
specify the first day of the week (i.e. Monday), it will adjust the range to 
start from the Monday of the week specified.

To specify a single day, use `on`:

    on 25-Mar-2012
    
Again, the format can be anything that ruby can parse.


5. The **duration** currently is specified in minutes. Possibly later refinements
will allow things like "1h 30m", but right now, the first number is interpreted
as the duration in minutes. For your fellow list-members, you can add "mins" or 
"minutes" to the end to be clear:

    90 mins


So putting it all together: here are some examples of valid subject lines for
event proposals:

    Availability for All Hands Meeting | week of Mar 19  | 120 min
    
    Picnic | on 25-Mar-2012 | 60
    
    AVAILABILITY FOR social gathering | week of 2012-03-20  | 90minutes
